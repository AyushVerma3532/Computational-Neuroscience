An LIF_Neuron or Leaky Integrate and Fire Neuron is an approximated model for the neurons that are present in biological brains. These neurons' inputs and outputs are in the form of current pulses. The code here is a model for the LIF neuron that on given inputs and weights and other selected hyperparameters, plots the curve of the membrane potential of the neuron and gives the time instances of the output pulses.
